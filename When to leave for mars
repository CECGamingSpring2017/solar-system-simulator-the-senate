After much planning, we have decided that the day we lift off to go to planet mars would be the 11th of August, 2018.
On the 761st day of the simulation, or august 11th in 2018, we'd launch the shuttle off to it's course labelled in picture 21.  This is
because day 761 is the closest the two planets are in a reasonable amount of time to wait.  Our course, which is outlined in the picture,
will send the shuttle to a future point of Mars' orbit, so it can reach the planet before it gets out of range.  Another group of
astronauts, the team of Levi and Jamie, decided to leave closer to February of 2017, for the reason that they are close to eachother at
that time as well.
